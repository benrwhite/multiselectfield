MultiSelectField 
----------------

A field primarily for managing has_many and many_many relationships, but should
also work with Varchar fields.

Presents an interface composed of two listboxes with add/remove buttons to move
items from one box to the other. Sometimes refered to as an "options transfer"
field.

Code has now been rewritten to make it more portable:

- Extends standard SilverStripe CheckboxSetField and inherits it's constructor
- Degrades to a standard <select multiple="multiple"> field without javascript

Example use:

  static $many_many = array ('ThingPages'=>'ThingPage');

  $source = DataObject::get('ThingPages);
  new MultiSelectField(
    "ThingPages", // Relationship
    "Related Thing Pages", // Field name
    $source->map('ID','Title') // Source records (array)
  )
